# HotKey README

This is a Starcraft 2 inspired hotkey system for VsCode. It allows you to assign hotkeys to the currently open file for quick access.

## Features

Hotkey files using ```<cntrl> + <number>```.  
Bring up hotkeyed files using ```<shift> + <number>``` while in --Insert-- mode.

## Requirements

This extension is dependent on the vim extension (vimvscode).

## Release Notes

I am excited to announce the first version of my Starcaft 2 style hotkey system for VsCode.
